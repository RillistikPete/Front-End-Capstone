# Workout Tracker

Workout Tracker is an easy-to-use system that keeps track of your exercising
schedule for each week. You can choose from suggested workout plans on the
Suggested Workouts page and add them to your weekly schedule. If you're
familiar with working out, feel free to create your own by clicking Create Workout. Keep track of your weekly workout plan on the My Workouts page. Click on Quote of the Day for a random quote for inspiration! Also click "Weightlifting Instructions" if you are unsure how to do ANY exercise. Have fun and enjoy.
